Personal Project 2 - The Analyzer 250

The Analyzer 250 is a tool used to help make analysis on the results of the ALTESC250 spreadsheet easier.

Useful for those who:
- Don't like to tediously order each user's ranking of each song of a specific category.
- Want a cleaner interface when analyzing the results without the other songs or results taking up the screen as well.
- Analyze how much each country has risen or fallen from the ranking each year.
